# Composing

Here you will find a selection of docker compose files that, for those wanting to get into self-hosting, might find useful.

This is a summary of docker-compose repos I have created in the past, along with a few new useful services and updates to existing services.

To use, you simply need `Docker`, `Docker-Compose`. It works best if can forward ports `443` and `80` in you router to your server device and have a domain that uses CloudFlare DNS (other provides are normally still easy to change to with træfik).

## Services

Each service has a short description in their directory. Below is a list of all services, existing here now, and to exist here in the near future.

## Usage

To run any of these services, I suggest the use of Træfik! To set this up, navigate to the `traefik` directory and run:

```bash
docker network create traefik-network
docker-compose up -d
```

(Remember to create the `.env` file for the træfik system first!!)

Beyond this, each directory contains a docker compose file and and an example `.env` file. Modify the env, using values appropriate to your setup, then simply run the following in the directory:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
